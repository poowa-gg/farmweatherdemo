# FarmWeather - Pitch Deck for Wennovation Hub

## 1. Problem Statement
**Nigerian farmers lose billions yearly due to unreliable weather information**

- 90%+ of Nigerian farmers rely on rainfed agriculture
- NiMet forecasts are too broad and often late
- Wrong weather decisions = crop failure, financial loss, food insecurity
- Farmers distrust existing forecasts (NiMet 2025 review)

**Real Impact:**
- Planting at wrong time → crop failure
- No irrigation warning → drought damage
- No flood alert → total loss
- Wrong harvest timing → reduced quality/price

## 2. Solution
**Hyperlocal climate intelligence platform delivering actionable weather insights**

### Core Features (MVP):
1. **Location-Specific Forecasts** - 7-day weather outlook for each farm
2. **SMS Alerts** - Daily weather updates sent to farmers' phones
3. **Smart Recommendations** - When to plant, irrigate, harvest based on weather + crop type
4. **Risk Alerts** - Early warnings for floods, droughts, extreme heat

### Why It Works:
- Hyperlocal (not state-wide)
- Actionable (not just data)
- Accessible (SMS for feature phones)
- Affordable (freemium model)
